Boss Checklist is a mod that adds a menu to the game, accessible by pressing P, containing all the bosses from all the mods in your modpack. For each boss, you can view their model/image, drops, spawn conditions, whether they were killed in the world and by whom, as well as some additional information like health.

This mod is primarily client-side, but can be installed on the server to automatically mark defeated bosses.

The boss list can be edited via assets/bosses.json for the client and data/server_bosses_ids.json for the server.

- You can write suggestions in pull requests or issues with the [suggestion] appended regarding translations and adding new bosses.
